# Gizmo Clone (GSD Learning Project)

A lightweight, local-first revision tool designed to automatically generate study flashcards from raw text input using AI.

This project serves as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for the **"Get S*** Done" (GSD)** development framework using **Claude Code**.

### Key Features
* **AI-Powered Generation:** Uses LLMs to parse unstructured notes and output Q&A pairs.
* **Local Storage:** Efficient data management using **SQLite**.
* **Clean Architecture:** Built using Python with a focus on modularity and speed.

### Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Database:** SQLite
* **AI orchestration:** Claude Code / LLM Integration
* **Framework:** GSD (Get S*** Done) methodology

### Purpose
To validate the GSD workflow and test the efficiency of Claude Code in reducing hallucinations compared to standard coding assistants.
