# Environment Variables for AI Flashcard Generator
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file to .env (in the same directory)
# 2. Fill in your actual values below
# 3. NEVER commit the .env file to git (it's already in .gitignore)
#
# For students: Environment variables keep sensitive data (like API keys) separate
# from your code. This way, you can share your code publicly without exposing secrets.

# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Your API key for Claude AI
#
# How to get your API key:
# 1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
# 2. Sign up or log in to your Anthropic account
# 3. Create a new API key
# 4. Copy it and paste it below (replace "your_api_key_here")
#
# Note: You'll need this for Phase 2 when we add AI flashcard generation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# SECRET_KEY: Flask session security key (optional for development)
# If not set, a random key will be generated each time the app starts
# For production, you should set this to a fixed random value
# Generate one with: python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# DATABASE_PATH: Location of SQLite database file (optional)
# Defaults to 'flashcards.db' in the project root
# DATABASE_PATH=flashcards.db
